        <h2>My Interest and Hobbies</h2>
         <p>I enjoy Video Games mainly Rainbow Six, Football, and Basketball. I don't play for Norwood Norfolk yet but i'm gonna this year. On my free time I tend to ride my bike down the road from my house and go to my grandpas lot and go on this track I made myself.</p>
         
         <h2>GOALS AND FUTURE PLANS</h2>
         
         <p>I'm not sure what I want to do with my life yet for a career. Anyway my future goals are getting a beater Honda Civic and pimping it out.
