            <p>I enjoy playing Basketball for <a href="https://nncsk12.org/"target= "_blank"> my school team.</a> Basketball is like a getaway for me because anytime im playing everything just leaves me. My favorite Basketball team is the <a href="https://www.nba.com/clippers/"target="_blank">LA clippers</a>  bevause Kawhi Leonard is on the team and he is my favorite player. I highly enjoy eating food mainly pizza because who doesnt like pizza.My favorite kind've pizza is <a href="https://thecozycook.com/buffalo-chicken-pizza/"target="_blank">buffalo pizza</a> because normal pizza is just over hyped. I really enjoy sleeping and waking up from a great nap. If I dont answer someone or I'm silent in my room im normally sleeping. </p>
